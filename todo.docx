Building a book library app using Flask in Python is a great idea! Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can implement it:

Set up the Flask project:

Create a new Flask project directory.
Set up a virtual environment and install Flask.
Create the basic project structure with necessary files and folders.
Define the database model:

Decide on the database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) and set up the database connection.
Define a Book model with attributes like title, author, genre, and cover image URL.
Create the necessary database tables and relationships using Flask SQLAlchemy.
Create the routes and views:

Define routes for different pages/views, such as the home page, book list, and book details.
Create view functions for each route to handle the requests and render the corresponding templates.
Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for books.
Implement book list and search functionality:

Create a template for the book list page to display all the books in the library.
Fetch the books from the database and pass them to the template for rendering.
Implement search functionality, allowing users to search for books by title or author.
Display the search results dynamically without refreshing the page using JavaScript and AJAX.
Add book details and CRUD functionality:

Create a template for the book details page to display the details of a specific book.
Implement functionality to view, edit, and delete books.
Create forms for adding new books and updating existing book details.
Validate and handle form submissions using Flask-WTF.
Include sorting and filtering options:

Add sorting functionality to sort the book list based on attributes like title, author, or genre.
Implement filtering options to allow users to view books based on specific criteria, such as genre or author.
Enhance the user interface:

Style the app using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap to make it visually appealing.
Add responsive design to ensure the app looks good on different devices.
Implement pagination if the book library grows large.
Test and debug:

Test the app thoroughly to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
Handle errors and exceptions gracefully and provide appropriate error messages to users.
Use logging to track errors and debug any issues that may arise.
